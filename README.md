# Collaborative-Online-Judge-System

    • Implemented a web-based collaborative code editor which supports multiple user editing simultaneously (ACE, Socket.io, Redis);

    • Designed and developed a single-page web application for coding problems (Angular2, Auth0, Node.js, MongoDB);

    • Built a user-code executor service which can build and execute user’s code (Docker, Flask);

    • Refactored and Improved system throughput by decoupling services using RESTful API and loading balancing by Nginx (REST API, Nginx).

## Development environment
- **AngularJS** is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web application framework to develop **single-page applications**.
- **Angular CLI** is a command line interface for Angular. We use commands such as **"ng generate"**, **"ng serve"** and so on.
- **Bootstrap** contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, **navigation** and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
